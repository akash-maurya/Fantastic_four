1. Need to complete tokeniseSourceCode . We'll have to go multifile later on and test out with make before we're confident about merging with the rest of the project. 
2. As a better alternative to the boolean function we were talking about, we can have a function that returns the enum which stores all our token name types, which can be used for the text. Code will be shorter, snappier and easier to read. Do give it a shot @Vikrant!
